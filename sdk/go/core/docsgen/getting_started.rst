Overview
========

The YANG Development Kit (YDK) is a Software Development Kit that provides API's that are modeled in YANG. The main goal of YDK is to reduce the learning curve of YANG data models by expressing the model semantics in an API and abstracting protocol/encoding details.  YDK is composed of a core package that defines services and providers, plus one or more module bundles that are based on YANG models.

System Requirements
